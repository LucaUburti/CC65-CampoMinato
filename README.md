# CC65-CampoMinato - Minesweeper - C version
Minesweeper - CC65 based

By popular demand (by me!), a remake of the evergreen minesweeper game for the evergreen Commodore 64
This time in C thanks to the cc65 cross compiler

See https://github.com/LucaUburti/commodore64 for a somewhat similar version in Basic I did a couple years ago
